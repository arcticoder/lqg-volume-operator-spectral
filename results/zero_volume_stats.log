=== ZERO-VOLUME STATE ANALYSIS RESULTS ===
Analysis run on: analyze_zero_volume_states.py
Timestamp: 2025-05-27T04:54:53

Total configurations analyzed: 60
Trivial zero-volume states (J12 cap J34 = empty): 60
Non-trivial zero-volume states (kernel exists): 0

Trivial states satisfying Diophantine condition: 60/60
Percentage: 100.0%

No non-trivial kernel states found.

This confirms the Diophantine root catalog assertion:
All zero-volume states in the scanned range are trivial (empty intersection).
