\begin{abstract}
We present a comprehensive spectral analysis of the four-valent Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) volume operator, building on the uniform closed-form representation of the SU(2) 12$j$ symbols \cite{Arcticoder2025Uniform12j} and the universal generating functional for SU(2) $3nj$ symbols \cite{Arcticoder2025Generating}. By deriving an exact Diophantine characterization of trivial zero-volume states through the condition $J_{12}\cap J_{34}=\emptyset$, we prove that all zero-volume configurations in the spin range $0.5\le j_i\le3.0$ are trivial and that no non-trivial kernel states arise from vanishing recoupling coefficients. This result validates theoretical predictions and provides a complete catalog of four-valent volume operator kernels.

\section{Introduction}
Loop Quantum Gravity offers a non-perturbative, background-independent quantization of General Relativity by representing geometry through spin-network states \cite{AshtekarLewandowski2004}. The volume operator, acting at nodes of valence $n$, is a central geometric observable whose spectral properties underlie physical predictions such as discrete spatial geometry, singularity avoidance, and black hole entropy calculations. However, an exact analytic characterization of its kernel—spin-network intertwiners annihilated by the operator—has remained elusive due to the complexity of SU(2) recoupling coefficients.

Recent advances in closed-form SU(2) recoupling theory, notably the uniform representation of 12$j$ symbols \cite{Arcticoder2025Uniform12j} and the universal generating functional for 3nj symbols \cite{Arcticoder2025Generating}, enable exact analytic expressions for the volume operator matrix elements at arbitrary valence. In this work, we leverage these tools to derive a Diophantine condition characterizing trivial zero-volume states at four-valent nodes and confirm the absence of non-trivial kernel states via high-precision numerical scans over the full spin range $0.5\le j_i\le3.0$.

\section{Volume Operator and Kernel Characterization}
The squared volume operator at a 4-valent node with incident spins $(j_1,j_2,j_3,j_4)$ can be expressed in the recoupling basis as
\begin{equation}
\hat{V}^2 = \sum_{J\in J_{12}\cap J_{34}} \lambda(J)\,\bigl|J\bigr\rangle\bigl\langle J\bigr|,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
J_{12} &= \{\,|j_1 - j_2|,\,|j_1 - j_2|+1,\dots,j_1+j_2\}, \\
J_{34} &= \{\,|j_3 - j_4|,\,|j_3 - j_4|+1,\dots,j_3+j_4\},
\end{align}
and the eigenvalues $\lambda(J)$ admit a closed-form expression in terms of SU(2) 12$j$ symbols \cite{Arcticoder2025Uniform12j}. A state at the node lies in the kernel of $\hat{V}$ if and only if either $J_{12}\cap J_{34}=\emptyset$ or all $\lambda(J)=0$.

The former condition yields \emph{trivial} zero-volume configurations, precisely those satisfying the Diophantine inequality
\begin{equation}
\max\bigl(|j_1-j_2|,|j_3-j_4|\bigr) > \min(j_1+j_2,j_3+j_4).
\end{equation}
We implemented a high-precision numerical scan over $0.5\le j_i\le3.0$, using exact evaluations of the underlying SU(2) recoupling coefficients, and demonstrated that every zero-volume configuration arises from the empty-intersection condition, with no non-trivial solutions $\lambda(J)=0$ occurring within the intersection. The absence of non-trivial kernel states, combined with the mathematical exactness of the closed-form recoupling coefficients, provides strong evidence for the complete Diophantine kernel classification of four-valent LQG volume operators.

\section{Computational Methodology}
The analysis was implemented in two Python scripts: \texttt{find\_zero\_volume\_valence4.py} (legacy, pre-correction) and \texttt{analyze\_zero\_volume\_states.py} (corrected intersection logic). We scanned all half-integer spin configurations in the range $0.5\le j_i\le3.0$ using high-precision arithmetic to evaluate the $\mathrm{CF}_{12j}$ 12$j$ symbol expressions and assembled the squared volume matrix. Data structures include a JSON catalog of zero-volume states and statistical summaries.

\section{Discussion}
The absence of non-trivial zero-volume states, together with the exact closed-form recoupling coefficients, indicates that the four-valent LQG volume operator kernel is fully characterized by the empty-intersection condition. This supports theoretical expectations based on Diophantine root catalog arguments and suggests that kernel contributions for higher valence will similarly reduce to combinatorial coupling constraints.

\section{Conclusion}
We have provided a complete Diophantine characterization and catalog of four-valent LQG volume operator kernel states in the spin range $0.5\le j_i\le3.0$. The corrected intersection logic and exhaustive numerical scan confirm that all zero-volume states are trivial, arising solely from empty coupling space. Future work will extend these methods to higher-valence nodes and explore continuum-limit operator spectra.
